    "# Initial Classification Modeling for UNSW NB-15 cyberattack dataset\n",
    "Identifying cyberattacks can be considered both a classification problem and an anomaly detection problem. In this notebook, I treat it as a classification problem. The training and test csv's provided by the researchers actually have more attacks than normal observations, which makes them better for classification training. A companion notebook, `02b_improved classification`, runs classification examples with nearly 10x the observations, more thoughtful feature selection, and data pre-processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook was run using the numeric columns from the data with no type of preprocessing. I intended this as a baseline proof of concept using the provided training and test data. **The point of this notebook was to ensure that it was possible to run any sort of model on the dataset.** I suspected that the models below were performing too well, and brought in the test set to confirm whether or not things were over-fitting. Cross-validated scores on the provided training set were similar to those from a holdout of the training set. When I then got >.1 decreases in scores for the test set, I reasoned that the test set contained types of attacks not present in the training set.\n",
    "\n",
    "The (relatively) poor results seen here were the catalyst for going back and spending more time understanding the features' real-world meaning and the distribution of their values. Having a \"dumb\" first pass to compare against later attempts lets me gauge the extent to which later efforts improve or reduce model performance."
