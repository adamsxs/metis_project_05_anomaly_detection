    "# Anomaly Detection for UNSW NB-15 cyberattack dataset\n",
    "Identifying cyberattacks can be considered both a classification problem and an anomaly detection problem. In this notebook, I treat it as an anomaly detection problem. Given that [the training and test csv's provided by the researchers](https://cloudstor.aarnet.edu.au/plus/index.php/s/2DhnLGDdEECo4ys?path=%2FUNSW-NB15%20-%20CSV%20Files%2Fa%20part%20of%20training%20and%20testing%20set) are balanced between the normal and anomaly classes, I'm going to down-sample to reduce the available number of anomalies."
